polygon_game_android
====================

If (but not "and only if") you are reading this file you are maybe interested in the content of this repo.
It contains the source code that I originally develop to made a funny (I think that's funny) game for my son.
Maybe one day I will generate an Android app and I'll make it accessible on Play.
The game is under construction and is very simple ... you can choose between a set of polygon and move/rotate them over the screen ... the movement/rotation algorythm is still not perfect but I'm working on.
