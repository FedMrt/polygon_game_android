polygon_game_android
====================

If (but not "and only if") you are reading this file you are maybe interested in the content of this repo.
It contains the source code that I originally developed to made a funny educational game for my son.
The game is under construction and is very simple ... you can choose between a set of polygon and move/rotate them over the screen ... the movement/rotation algorythm is still not perfect but I'm working on. I'd like you enjoy it .... have fun (maybe you'd like to improve it to make it more funny)!!! 

NOTE: jars under lib must be added to classpath
